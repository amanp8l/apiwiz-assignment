# apiwiz-assignment

This project is a Spring Boot and MySQL application that allows you to:

Retrieve the currency values from an open currency API for the past 30 days and store them in your local database (preferably MongoDB)
Expose an endpoint that predicts a specific currency value on a given date based on the past 30 days' currency values
Expose another endpoint that converts a given amount of USD to another G10 currency's value based on the most recent currency value.
You can use sample cURL commands to test the endpoints and receive sample responses.
